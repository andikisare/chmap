# Synoptic Maps

These example maps used data from June 1 to July 1 2011. The functions to create basic full synoptic EUV/CHD Maps of 
 user defined time periods can be found
[here](https://github.com/predsci/CHD/blob/master/chmap/maps/synoptic/synoptic_funcs.py).

## Example Maps for the Month of June 2011
