## Introduction to Graph Theory

AÂ GraphÂ G(V,Â E) is a data structure that is defined by a set of **Vertices** (or Nodes) (V) and and a set of **Edges** (E).
In anÂ undirected graphÂ G(V,Â E), twoÂ verticesÂ uÂ andÂ vÂ are calledÂ connectedÂ ifÂ GÂ contains aÂ pathÂ fromÂ uÂ toÂ v. 
Otherwise, they are calledÂ disconnected. If the two vertices are additionally connected by a path of lengthÂ 1, 
i.e. by a single edge, the vertices are calledÂ adjacent. 

AÂ graphÂ is said to beÂ **connected**Â if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. 
This means that there is aÂ pathÂ between every pair of vertices.
An undirected graph that is not connected is calledÂ disconnected. 
An undirected graphÂ GÂ is therefore disconnected if there exist two vertices inÂ GÂ such that no path inÂ GÂ has these vertices as endpoints. 

In our project, the coronal hole database will be a set ofÂ **connected subgraphs**, where nodes are coronal hole contour object (see Contour.py) and edges connect identified coronal holes between frames (given area overlap results). The height/depth of the graph represents the number of frame connections. 

## Implementation

In Python, there are several libraries available that provide Graph functionality. After some reading , 
it seems as Networkx is commonly used and is easy to use. In the module CoronalHoleGraph.py, 
there is a class called CoronalHoleGraph() . This class is the data structure that will store identified 
contours and their connectivity. For plotting purposes, each contour will be associated with a frame number (y-axis) 
and count (x-axis) in case of repetition in the same frame. Connectivity is determined by the area overlap of two contours. 

- Q: Should we connect the contour with the previously identified contour from the same class or to declare and edge with any contour saved in the latest "window" frame that has an area overlap? - Can be discussed on ThursdayğŸ™‚

### Important Networkx functions

- *nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G)* - Extract all isolated connected subgraphs and plot each subgraph separately. 

- *nx.draw()* - Plot the Graph using Matplotlib.
