# Coronal Hole Area Overlap

In order to accurately match coronal holes between frames, we will evaluate the area overlapping the two regions. 
Say we have two coronal holes $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, where $C_{1}$ was identified in a previous frame, and $C_{2}$ was identified in 
the latest frame and yet to be classified. Assuming [KNN](knn.md) algorithm resulted in a high probability of the two coronal holes 
being associated, we will now measure their area overlap.  
Let $S_{1}$, $S_{2}$ denote the set of pixel locations associated with $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ respectively. 
Therefore, the area overlapped by the two regions is $\Delta A(S_{1} \cap S_{2})$.  


The area overlap will be measured as an average of the latest $m$ ($\approx 5-10$) frames. 
$$ P = \frac{1}{m} {\sum}_{n=0}^{m} \frac{\Delta A(S^{1, n} \cap S^{?})}{\Delta A(S^{?})}â€Ž$$


Then, if the probability is higher than some threshold, we classify the new coronal hole as a previously detected coronal hole ($P > \xi$), 
otherwise, the new identified coronal hole will get a new unique ID.
