# Coronal Hole Tracking (CHT) Algorithm

## Overview 

We propose an algorithm to track coronal holes evolution in EUV imagery, study connectivity, open magnetic flux regions, and 
compute coronal hole features such as area, centroid, tilt, etc..

CHT provides important information for investigating the evolution of well-observed and long-lived coronal holes (CH).
