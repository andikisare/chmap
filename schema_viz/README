The routines in this folder read/query the database and make and html
document that summarizes the data and schema.  Maybe the most useful 
item is the diagram of tables with primary keys, indices, and column 
relationships visualized.

Software requirements:
    Java 5 or higher
    graphviz (I installed graphviz-devel: port install graphviz-devel)

The basic process is this:
1. Make changes to database schema.
      - as defined in DB_classes.py using SQLAlchemy
2. Generate an instance of the new format.
      - Probably easiest to delete test_data/dbtest.db and then run
        example001_DB-workflow.py to create a sample SQLite DB.
      - Update: we now have an instance of the database running all
	the time on Q, so probably easiest to follow the 'For MySQL'
	instructions in step 3 below.
3. Run schemaspy to generate the new documentation.
      - For SQLite:
        $ cd sqlite
        $ java -jar ../schemaspy-6.1.0.jar -dp sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.1.jar
        This will use the files sqlite/schemaspy.properties and 
        sqlite/sqlite.properties files to set properties.  Alter 
        schemaspy.properties to change the DB or output paths.

      - For MySQL:
        $ cd mysql
	$ java -jar ../schemaspy-6.1.0.jar -dp mysql-connector-java-8.0.12.jar 
	  -u my_username -pfp
	This still uses properties files mysql/schemaspy.properties and 
	mysql/mysql.properties, but you will need to enter your username
	as an argument in the command line. It will then prompt for 
	password. 
	
	The files 'schemaspy-6.1.0.jar', 'sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.1.jar', and 
	'mysql-connector-java-8.0.12.jar' are third party applications and 
 	not included with this distribution.  Download urls are listed below.
	The commands listed above should work for more recent versions of these
	files, but user mileage may vary.
	File download urls and expected locations:
		schemaspy: https://schemaspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
			   schema_viz/schemaspy-6.1.0.jar
		mysql-connector: https://www.mysql.com/products/connector/
				 schema_viz/mysql/mysql-connector-java-8.0.12.jar
		sqlite-connector: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc
				  schema_viz/sqlite/sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.1.jar

4. View results
      - In the output/ directory, open index.html. The subdirectories of 
        output/ also contain some nice PNG images of table relationships.
