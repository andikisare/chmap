# About the Project

CHMAP is a python package focused on the detection, mapping, tracking, and
general analysis of coronal holes in the solar corona.

CHMAP includes methods for:

- Data Acquisition
- Data Reduction
- Limb Brightening Correction
- Inter-Instrument Scaling
- Flexible Map Creation
- Coronal Hole Detection
- Coronal Hole Tracking

Although CHMAP was designed for analyzing coronal hole evolution from seconds to
years, many of the database, image processing, and mapping procedures are
relevant a broad range of solar features and scientific analysis.

A research paper describing the initial release of CHMAP and some applications
is currently in preparation. In the meantime, if you use CHMAP code or concepts
in your own work, please refer to our prior work on this topic 
([Caplan et al., 2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...823...53C)) and cite

The development of CHMAP was primarily supported by the NASA Heliophysics Guest
Investigators program (grant NNX17AB78G). Additional support is from the
Heliophysics Supporting Research program (grants 80NSSC18K0101 & 80NSSC18K1129).
