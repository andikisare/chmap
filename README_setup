This package needs to be configured for the local machine environment.

This package also requires a custom python environment.
See notes/NOTES_psi_software.txt and notes/NOTES_PythonGettingStarted.rtf 
for more information.

To configure, edit setup.conf to reflect your local system environment.
Then run ./setup.sh: e.g.

vi setup.conf
./setup.sh setup.conf

This will create the settings/app.py file from settings/app.py.template
