#
# - most of this development was done using the anaconda python distribution and 
#   conda to manage package installation.
# - I got the idea from the sunpy installation guide.
#
# - Here I try to keep a recod of the commands I used so that I can make installing 
#   this environment on other computers as straightforward as possible
#
# - NOTE: It may be easier to install these interactively through 
#   the project interpreter menu of PycharmCE.
#   - This may help set up a custom environment specific to this project.
#
# - here is documentation on conda environments.

conda install sunpy

# hdf4 package (pyhdf)
conda search pyhdf
conda install pyhdf

# hdf5 package (h5py)
conda search h5py
conda install h5py

# SDO JSOC drms package
conda search drms
conda install drms

# SQLAlchemy (for manipulating SQL databases)
